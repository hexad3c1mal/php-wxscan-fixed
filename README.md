# Weatherscan Simulation (legacy) Patched
Weatherscan Simulator made by /u/AnonChickenWalker, patched primarily by flybotworld, and shibedev12 helped a tad 

To start the PHP Version of the Weatherscan sim, simply run
```php -S 0.0.0.0:8080```

This version is as unedited and close to source as possible, with dead APIs being replaced, and expired API Keys replaced.
Have fun, and remember that this is not great, this is old.
If you want the good version, check online at:
If you like mist: [https://v2.weatherscan.net]
If you are more of a rancher: [https://v2.weatherscan.me]
Cheers!
